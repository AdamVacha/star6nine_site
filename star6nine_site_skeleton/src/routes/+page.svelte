	<!-- BIO -->
<!-- <div class="card p-4 m-4 variant-outline-primary">BIO - Star6nine is a dubstep project started in 2021 by electronic music producer Adam Vacha. With a lifetime of music theory and composition training *69 was started from scratch. The sounds herein hail from a foreign region of deep space that extends out into a signature dark bass music profile. From the age of 12 learning classical guitar and piano at the Center for the Arts program in St. Petersburg Florida, to the Pinellas County Center for the Arts Program for Highschool and eventually Berklee College of Music for music production, it is safe to say much training has been put into Star6nine’s new iconic sound. 2 years were spent hidden away in recording studios to bring forth the best possible product and now is the time Star6nine hits the stage to show the world it’s new music.
		With 100’s of hours performing on stage across the country Star6nine is no stranger to live performance or DJ’ing events. Having run a recording studio on La Cienega Blvd in Hollywood CA while DJ’ing raves on the weekends in Los Angeles, not only has the time been put into the studio but the live sets as well. Unique and powerful double drops coupled with driving and extremely deep bass lead to live DJ sets that truly move the crowd.
